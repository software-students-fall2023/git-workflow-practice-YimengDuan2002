The aritle I am interested in is [Software Engineering Is About More Than Just the Code](https://medium.com/swlh/software-engineering-is-about-more-than-just-the-code-67e79c901cd4).
The article discusses the change of people's perception about the career of software engineer. The author thinks a good software engineer do more than just code. The author talks about the evolution IT industry in recent decades, starting from early programmers and expanding into various specialized roles. He emphacizes that software Engineers should realzie the importance of value chain that the enterprises wish to achieve and learn to work in collaborative teams and understand continuous deployment processes.

# Lara Kim Edit: 
I also found this article very interesting, because before reading it, I hadn't known about Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment, let alone the differences between them. I liked reading about what a good software engineer does, especially because I am thinking of becoming one. Especially since this career track is full of difficulties and can be discouraging at times, this article helped me grasp what it truly means to become a good engineer. 



### Ashley Luo Comments:

This article is pretty interesting. The Software Value Chain is a concept that describes the various stages and activities involved in the development, delivery, and maintenance of software products or services, with the aim of creating value for both the providers and consumers of the software. CI/CD is very important in all kinds of software engineering and I have never learnt such things in previous courses. I believe I need to know more tools/workflows before becoming a software engineer.
